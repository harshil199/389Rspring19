## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

It took me a while to figure out how to do this homework. At first i kept trying nc domain and pass in the ipadress when I was prompted. This lead to no response. After that i tried a bunch of commands such as ipaddress cd home or cd root but those did not work either. I then went and searched up how to pass in commands for injections and someone said something about chaining commands with ; and thats when i tried to do ipaddress; ls and it worked and it displayed all the directories.  After that I tried to cd into alot of the directories to see if i can find the flag but it started to get annoying because it would only let me execute 1 command and then kick me out. So I tried to keep doing that but eventually i gave up and decided to see if i could write the script to see if i can use the shell in order to find the flag. Once i wrote the script I was able to use the shell to find the flag in /home/flag.txt. After i found that i used the tools in the shell and see if I can use the pull command to see if i can pull the flag.txt to my desktop and it worked. This was a cool project because I was actually able to implement a tool that i built and use that tool in order to do something interesting. Most of the time in cyber sec you usually use tools that are already out there and they aren't that great. This gives you the ability to customize the tools i am making to my liking.
