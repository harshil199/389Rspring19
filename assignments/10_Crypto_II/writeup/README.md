### Part 2 (30 Pts)

![cbc](cbc.bmp)

1. After viewing both images it is clear that the cbc image is compeltely unclear and you cannot make out anything from it and the ecb picture you can still make out the general shape of the image although the colors are a bit off.
2. Just from looking at the pictures you can tell that ecb is much less secure and that you can find information about the picture even after is encrypted. After reading up on ecb and cbc it seems that ecb uses the same encryption for each pixel so the pixels with the same image will be encrypted the same. Meanwhile cbc uses encryption based on the previous pixel so every encryption will be different.
